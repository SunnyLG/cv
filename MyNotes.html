        <li>If you do what other successful	 people do, over and over again, nothing can stop you from eventually getting the same results that they do. #Brian Tracy</li>
        <li>Your thoughts create your reality. You do not see the world as it is but rather as you are. Everywhere you look, you see yourself. In a larger sense, your outer world is a mirror of your inner world. #Brian Tracy</li>
        <li>It's in Christ that we find out who we are and what we are living for. #Rick Warren </li>
        <li>You can usually succeed in reaching a goal if you put your mind to it. But being successful and fulfilling your life's purpose are not at all the same issue! You could reach all your personal goals, becoming a raving success by the world's standard, and still miss the purposes for which God created you. #Rick Warren</li>
        <li>The easiest way to discover the purpose of an invention is to ask the creator of it. The same is true for discovering your life's purpose: Ask God. #Rick Warren</li>
        <li>Salvation is a miracle! Salvation is the greatest transformative miracle of the Holy Spirit! Salvation is the mighty Hand of God at work! Salvation is the unbelievable mercy of God in action! #Dag Heward-Mills</li>
